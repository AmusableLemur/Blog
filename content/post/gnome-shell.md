title: An efficient work environment in Gnome Shell
---

At work or at home I mainly use a Ubuntu + Gnome Shell setup for getting work done. While Gnome Shell has its limitations it can be dramatically improved with the right extensions. At least for now I don't know any better option.

With my current setup I have support for multiple desktops which is useful for switching contexts between e.g. communication and development. The multiple desktops are also a benefit for laptop work as I am otherwise limited to a single screen for workspace.

In addition to the built in features I have native support for Pomodoro, task management, weather indicator, time tracking, and integrated media controls for Spotify.

This is a complete list of everything that makes Gnome Shell an efficient work environment for me.

### Dash to Dock
"A dock for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash out of the overview transforming it in a dock for an easier launching of applications and a faster switching between windows and desktops. Side and bottom placement options are available."

### Hamster Time Tracker
The time tracker is useful for billable work or work estimations. By specifying a task it will automatically start tracking time for that task until paused or switched to a new task.

### Media player indicator
This allows e.g. Spotify to be controlled through the volume menu. Also provides song indication with album cover and such.

### OpenWeather
"Weather extension to display weather information from openweathermap.org or darksky.net for almost all locations in the world."

### Pomodoro
This extension markets itsels as "A simple pomodoro timer" but is hands down the best Pomodoro timer I have ever used regardless of platform or OS.

### Todo.txt
A simple task manager and to-do list integrated into the task bar. Also integrates with Todo.txt for storing, exporting, and importing data.
