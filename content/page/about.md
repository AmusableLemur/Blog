My name is Rasmus Larsson and I’m currently studying for a degree in computer science and engineering (MSc) at Lund University in Sweden. Whenever school isn’t taking up all of my time I’m also working as a Software Engineer at an innovative marketing firm called [Emerse](http://www.emerse.com/) where I develop and maintain their in-house business systems and analytic tools.

This blog is mostly set up as a writing exercise for me, I hope to improve my writing by forcing myself to write regularly in front of an audience. It also serves as a way for me to create an online presence and show of some of my work. I’m trying to keep my posts short and not so shitty, the first bit is easy.
