title: Resolutions for 2016
type: post

Inspired by ["12 resolutions for programmers"](http://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/) I decided to write a post on my own aspirations this year. I may or may not expand on this over the upcoming months. We'll see.

 * Eat healthier
 * Play more games
 * Learn a new language
 * Read more books
 * Start using a password manager
 * Create something in an unfamiliar language (Clojure or Go maybe?)
 * Get better at math
