Microsoft released Windows 10 yesterday. Normally you can't install it until you
receive the update from Microsoft but downloading the installer will allow you
to get the latest and greatest immediately. (link for the curious)

I installed it today and it appears to have solved all my gripes with 8.1 and
the ridiculous tablet-designed touch interface that didn't work for regular
mouse and keyboard input. The only problem I've had, and wow has it been
frustrating, is that my two graphics cards doesn't work at the same time.

With three monitors it appears I can now only get either the two on my one card,
or the other monitor on my second card to work at any given time. This is
normally an issue when using cards from different vendors that refuse to work
well together. But this shouldn't be an issue when I have two Nvidia cards.

Luckily I managed to figure out a work-around.

It turns out that if I disable one card, reboot, uninstall the other card,
reboot, reinstall the other card, reboot, disable the first card again and
reboot twice everything is back to normal again.

Other than that it's working out great!
